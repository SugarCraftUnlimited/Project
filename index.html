      <p class="caption">This is my newest profile picture, and i made it as recent as this year. I believe this one utilized color well, and is a bit more glow-y. this one has a more realistic shine, as well as amber edges for the hair.</p>

      <p class="caption">This was my first image to utilize my huion drawing tablet but i never finished it. This was for someone who liked dragons and i went with my old way of drawing by mouse but i used white over the hair, and that white is where i started to actually use and understand the tablet.</p>
